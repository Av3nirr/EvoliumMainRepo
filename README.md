Edit the Code
---------

Want to add new features to EvoPlugin or fix bugs yourself ? You can edit the code, by doing the following *four* things:

1. Download EvoPlugin's source code and put it somewhere. We recommend you use something called Git if you already know how to use it, but you can also just download a .zip file (https://github.com/Palmuss/EvoliumRepo/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). (If you plan on contributing the changes, you will need to figure out Git.)
2. Install any version of Java greater than or equal to 17.
3. Open terminal / command prompt / bash and navigate to the directory where you put the source code.

ðŸŽ‰ That's it. ðŸŽ‰

### Using a Java IDE

To edit EvoPlugin in a Java IDE, follow these steps:

1. Download and install [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
2. In the IDE, open the folder that you saved EvoPlugin's code in. This creates a new project in IDEA.

That's pretty much it.
